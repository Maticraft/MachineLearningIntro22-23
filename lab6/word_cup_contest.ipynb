    "The task is to predict the winner of the world cup 2022 on the basis of previous world cup results. The data is available in the file `worldcups.csv`, which contains the winners of the previous world cups. In the file `wcmatches.csv` you can find the results of all matches played in the world cups. The data is available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/abecklas/fifa-world-cup). You can use some part of the data for training and some part for testing.\n",

    "\n",
    "Few ideas for the prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Simple binary classification) Use the results of the matches in the group stage and 1st round of the knockout stage to to predict whether given country is a winner or not. -- disadvantage: the classes are not balanced (there are more losers than winners)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Predict each match independently, i.e. as features use the results of the given team in last 3 matches and the results of the opponent in last 3 matches. Then on this basis predict the result of the match. To get the final winner iterate through all matches in the knockout stage and predict the winner of each match.\n",
